## Overview



**Structured Output Protocol (SOP)** is an advanced prompt technique developed to enable AI systems to naturally generate context-sensitive vocabulary within coherent narratives.



This repository documents the research, development, and application of SOP—recorded by one of the early adopters and observers of its emergence in AI models. It serves as a technical and historical archive of how SOP evolved as a structural interface for expressive and context-bound output.
